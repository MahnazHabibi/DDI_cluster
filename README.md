# Machine learning-based Prediction for Drug-Drug Interaction Using a Knowledge Graph.

> Description: This repository contains the data and MATLAB code for the " prediction of the DDI network based on machine learning approaches".

**Data set:**

File "Drug_Drug_Interaction.xlsx" contains a list of interaction between Drugs.
File "List_of_Drug.xlsx" contains a list of drugs.

**Algorithms:**

File ".....m" is the MATLAB script to calculate topological and biological features for mutated genes.



To run the machine learning algorithm, follow the "Read_me.txt" steps.
